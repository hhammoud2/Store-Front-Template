# Store Front Template
A template app for use as a store front for purchasing clothing. Tableview used to display all categories and then collection view used to display the products in that category. Currently uses hard coded data for categories and products.


### Future Improvements
Add a tab menu which enters from the left and shows different sections, i.e. featured, shop by category, shopping cart
Add a shopping cart screen (No actual functionality, just a screen showing items in your cart with non-functional "check out" button)
Add individual screens for selected products with buttons to select quantity and add to cart
